# <ins>Design Pattern Coding exercises</ins>

Please follow these steps to start the exercises on your local machine:
1. Download a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. We recommend either IntelliJ Community Edition or Eclipse.
   - IntelliJ CE: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
   - Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2. Git clone the repository and deploys each project separately by running the Main.java file.
3. Each exercise contains some unfinished code, which is specified by "Add code here" comments. Please read the method documentation to understand and implement the code!
